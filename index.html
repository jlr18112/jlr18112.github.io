			<h1>JUSTIN RAYMAN</h1>
			<img src="IMG_0365.JPG" alt="Sports">
			<p>Growing up, I always <i>loved</i> playing sports. There were few things I would rather do when I got home from school than toss the 'ole pigskin around with the boys in the front yard. I was a pretty big deal in 7th grade. My favorite player of all time is Jason Collins, if you wanna look at his career stats, click <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/collija04.html">here</a>. Besides football, I played:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Hockey</li>
					<li>Baseball</li>
					<li>Basketball</li>
					<li>Soccer</li>
					<li>Gymnastics</li>
					<li>Pickleball</li>
				</ul>

			<p>That's me on the right! Wow, I was a cute kid, huh? This was my sister's 4th birthday, and she ate all the cake and didn't let me have any. What's the point of being the older brother if you don't get all the cake? I still haven't gotten over it.</p>

			<p>Me and little bro chillin'. His name is Josiah Rayman; I taught him everything he knows. We both go by J Ray ... yeah, it's kinda awkward. He loves to collect sea shells on family beach trips and taping pictures of pro athletes above his bed.</p>
