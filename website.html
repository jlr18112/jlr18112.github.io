<BODY>
My name is Justin Rayman, and I am a sophomore at the University of Georgia. 
I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and I have been a dawgs fan for my entire life. 
I am studying business management and plan on going into the car business when I graduate.
I have one younger brother, who is a senior in high school and plays quarterback for the football team.
My parents, Steve and Rosalinda, are very caring and awesome parents. They have given me more than I will ever be able to re pay them in my life.
